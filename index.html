    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>

Following the success of previous workshops on MAGnetically Induced Currents in molecules (MAGIC) held in Helsinki, Salerno, Kragujevac, Cambridge, and Chiemsee, 
        I am delighted to announce that the next workshop will take place in Edinburgh. 
        The workshop is scheduled from <b>Monday, June 1, 2026, to Friday, June 5, 2026</b>.  
   </p>
    <p>
The event will be hosted at the Pollock Estate, which will also provide accommodation for attendees.  

The workshop will explore various aspects of magnetically induced current densities in atoms and molecules from experimental, theoretical, and computational perspectives. Topics will include the relationship between chemical bonding and molecular magnetic properties, ensuring a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach.  
</p>
    <p>
One of the workshopâ€™s key aims is to foster connections between established scientists and early-career researchers, creating opportunities for future collaborations and advancing research in this exciting field.  

The program begins on Monday at noon with registration and a welcome session. Talks will commence on Tuesday morning after breakfast and continue through to Friday morning, with departure planned for noon. The workshop will feature themed sessions, each led by the first speaker of the session, who will also serve as the chair and discussion leader.  
</p>
To encourage active participation, all attendees are expected to give a talk, limiting the number of participants to approximately 35. Additionally, all participants will have the opportunity to present a poster, which will remain on display throughout the conference.

        Here&rsquo;s a good place to list the organizers and sponsors of the conference,
        as well as list contact information for the organizers,
        and show off the logos of the sponsors.
        It looks like his conference was sponsored by kittens!
