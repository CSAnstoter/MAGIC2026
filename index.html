    <h2>What is MAGIC?</h2>
    <p>

Following the success of previous workshops on MAGnetically Induced Currents in molecules (MAGIC) held in Helsinki, Salerno, Kragujevac, Cambridge, and Chiemsee, 
        I am delighted to announce that the 6th workshop will take place in Edinburgh. 
        <br>
        The workshop is scheduled from <b>Monday June 1st</b> to <b>Friday June 5th 2026</b>.  
   </p>
    <p> 

The workshop will explore various aspects of magnetically induced current densities in atoms and molecules from experimental, theoretical, and computational perspectives. Topics will include the relationship between chemical bonding and molecular magnetic properties, ensuring a comprehensive and interdisciplinary approach.  
</p>
    <p>
One of the workshopâ€™s key aims is to foster connections between established scientists and early-career researchers, creating opportunities for future collaborations and advancing research in this exciting field.  

The program begins on Monday at noon with registration and a welcome session. Talks will commence on Tuesday morning after breakfast and continue through to Friday morning, with departure planned for noon. The workshop will feature themed sessions, each led by the first speaker of the session, who will also serve as the chair and discussion leader.  
</p>
    <p>
To encourage active participation, all attendees are expected to give a talk, limiting the number of participants to approximately <b>35</b>. 
    </p>
